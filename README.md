## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox


### What I learned
The things I found difficult throughout this project was width, height. I have to get the right width, height or else the project would not come out right.

### Continued development

I Still need to focus on more on CSS. As I build more projects I will also continue to improve.
